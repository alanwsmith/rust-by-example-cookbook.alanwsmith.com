// Diverging functions
//
// Diverging functions never return. They are marked 
// using !, which is an empty type.
//
// As opposed to all the other types, this one cannot 
// be instantiated, because the set of all possible 
// values this type can have is empty. Note that, it 
// is different from the () type, which has exactly 
// one possible value.

// Need to dig more into this to figure out
// the best way to refine the example.
