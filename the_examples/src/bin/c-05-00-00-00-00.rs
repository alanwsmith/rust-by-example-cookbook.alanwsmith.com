/*
Rust provides several mechanisms to change or define the type of primitive and user defined types. The following sections cover:

Casting between primitive types
Specifying the desired type of literals
Using type inference
Aliasing types
*/

// From the page: "Rust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types. But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the as keyword."

// "Rules for converting between integral types follow C conventions generally, except in cases where C has undefined behavior. The behavior of all casts between integral types is well defined in Rust."
